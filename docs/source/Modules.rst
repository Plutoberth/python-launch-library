Models
------

As this library is based on the **launchlibrary** API, you can find a lot of info handily documented on `their website <https://launchlibrary.net/docs/1.4/api.html>`_ . 
Note that the wrapper only uses verbose mode.

Additionally, the parameters of every model can be accessed post-creation by using `model.param_names`.
